SQ encoder

I intend to write SQ (Stereo Quadraphonic) encoder as LADSPA plugin. For now i'm publishing proof-of-concept shellscript
wrapper around sox. It really works and outputs correctly encoded output. It was verified against Sony SQD-2020 hardware decoder and against my LADSPA decoder.

Internets are full of incomplete and even wrong information about SQ encoding. I hope that this example leads some
prospective quadies to right path. :)
